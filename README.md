# HCDE 410 Final Project
## Abstract
My HCDE 410 Final Project investigates how the impact of the acquisition of major NBA stars on a team's elo rating and winning championships.

Live broadcasted sports is a staple cornerstone amongst popular culture. These sports have their own professional leagues and they take on the big screens around the world. One of the most popular sports being televised is basketball with the NBA. Like any other pro sport, there is a factor of sport commentary that can open lengthly discussions on what NBA team is best and can make it to the Playoffs and Finals. Anybody can point to current and more recent NBA team match statistics to determine which NBA team ranks best at the moment, but it can be difficult to quantify how a team is better. With this in mind, I plan to conduct some data analysis on past NBA teams to investigate how might one team's elo[1] and how might certain NBA players play into the team's odds of winning championships.

FiveThirtyEight's usage of [their dataset](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/nba-elo) to capture each NBA team's [relative strength after every game](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nba/#warriors) shows the trends of their elo every season along with indicators of champtionship wins in a particular year. Their extensive visualizations of each team's elo trend does a great job showing where teams are at the start of the season and how they pan out at the end (with star indicators for winning a championship) of the season.
